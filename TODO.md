There's a bug found in an android phone where the snake doesn't display until the user rotates it to a vertical position and back to horizontal. I'll send you the screenshot.

They asked us to replace the last screen's animations (fireworks). I asked the agency to  do an animation that goes more with the background so they'll do that, we'll just replace it.

Add a mute button (I'll upload the icon)

They asked for a more colorful background. It will be the same but with more red, as soon as they share it with me, I'll upload it.
