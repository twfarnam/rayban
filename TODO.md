dont like the way the background looks scrolls on mobile 

weird borders on those other parts of the game

snake only grows every 3-4 foods ?

move Game header/footer to separate files

make sure all the stuff is removed from the grid

grid has fancy border and extra lines that are never used

preloads all the images at the right time
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="/wayfarer.png">

nice quotes in translations








# questions / needs
do you play when you have zero lives or it's game over?
button border won't work for longer text like "go to level 1"
